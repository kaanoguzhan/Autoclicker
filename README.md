A very simple Autoclicker with random delays on Pyton37

If you just want to use the program:

0) !! You must have Python installed !!

1) run "Run.bat"

That's it.


For Keyboard pressing you must give Hex code inside empty TextBox
Hex code is like "0x10".

You can find keyboard hex codes here: http://www.flint.jp/misc/?q=dik&lang=en
